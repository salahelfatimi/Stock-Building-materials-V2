# Stock-Building-materials-V2

Inventory management is a web application designed to streamline project management tasks by keeping track of the equipment used at construction sites. The application enables project managers to record and track the amount of equipment used by workers each day, including the depletion of equipment specific to each specialty. The project administrator can also add new workers, assign them unique login credentials, and monitor their work on the site. This system helps the administrator to accurately monitor the quantity of equipment used at each location, as well as the worker responsible for its use.
